# Analysis of Pi-hole Domain Sentiment Data

## Summary of Sentiment Analysis
- **Total domains analyzed:** 635
- **Positive sentiments:** 68 (10.71%)
- **Negative sentiments:** 567 (89.29%)

This summary indicates that the majority of the domains have been classified with a negative sentiment, suggesting that these domains might be associated with undesirable content, such as ad domains, trackers, or malicious sites. The high percentage of negative sentiments (89.29%) aligns with the typical use case of Pi-hole, which aims to block such domains.

## Top 5 Positive Domains
1. **best.aliexpress.com:** 0.999125
2. **secure.surveymonkey.com:** 0.999086
3. **discovery.meethue.com:** 0.998819
4. **presence.teams.microsoft.com:** 0.997769
5. **secure.netflix.com:** 0.997131

These domains have been identified as having the highest positive sentiment scores. This could imply that these domains are associated with trusted and commonly used services. For instance:
- **best.aliexpress.com**: A subdomain of the popular online marketplace AliExpress.
- **secure.surveymonkey.com**: A secure subdomain of SurveyMonkey, a well-known survey platform.
- **discovery.meethue.com**: Related to Philips Hue smart lighting systems.
- **presence.teams.microsoft.com**: Part of Microsoft's Teams service.
- **secure.netflix.com**: Related to the secure aspects of Netflix's services.

## Top 5 Negative Domains
1. **placehold.it:** 0.999634
2. **stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com:** 0.999523
3. **static.rust-lang.org:** 0.999366
4. **(\.|/)fake(.*)video(.*)url.webm$:** 0.999406
5. **static.opensubtitles.org:** 0.999429

These domains have the highest negative sentiment scores, indicating they might be flagged for undesirable content. For example:
- **placehold.it**: A placeholder image service, which might not inherently be negative but could be misused in phishing or spam.
- **stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com**: A content delivery network (CDN) for Bootstrap; again, not inherently negative, but could be flagged due to misuse or misunderstanding.
- **static.rust-lang.org**: Static resources for the Rust programming language, possibly flagged incorrectly.
- **(\.|/)fake(.*)video(.*)url.webm$**: This regex pattern matches URLs likely associated with fake or misleading video content.
- **static.opensubtitles.org**: Related to a subtitles service, which might be flagged due to association with pirated content.

## Real-World Applications
### 1. Improving Network Security
- The analysis can help in identifying and blocking malicious or undesirable domains.
- The high negative sentiment percentage suggests the need for stricter content filtering or further investigation into why these domains are flagged negatively.

### 2. Enhancing User Experience
- By identifying trusted domains with positive sentiments, network administrators can whitelist these domains to avoid unnecessary blocking of legitimate content.

### 3. Policy Making
- Organizations can create policies based on the sentiment analysis to allow or block specific domains, improving productivity and security.

### 4. Misclassification Insights
- The list of top negative domains includes some that might be misclassified (like Rust and Bootstrap resources). This insight can lead to refining the sentiment analysis model or re-evaluating domain classification criteria.

## Further Steps
### 1. Review and Verification
- Manually review the domains with high sentiment scores to verify the accuracy of the sentiment analysis.
- Cross-check with other threat intelligence sources to confirm the classification.

### 2. Model Improvement
- Enhance the NLP model to reduce false positives and improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.
- Incorporate additional features or contextual information to better classify domains.

### 3. Actionable Policies
- Implement automated policies based on the analysis to dynamically update the Pi-hole blocklist, ensuring it remains effective and relevant.

In summary, the data provides valuable insights into the nature of the domains interacting with the network, helping to enhance security measures, improve user experience, and inform policy decisions.
