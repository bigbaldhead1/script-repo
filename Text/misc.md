Hey so here is just a very preliminary finding on the traffic data for I-95 broken down into traffic flow estimates over different periods of time. Doing more detailed research from here.

### 1. **Obtain Traffic Data:**
   - **Sources**: Check with the state's Department of Transportation (DOT) where the section of I-95 is located. Many DOTs publish Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) counts, which estimate the number of vehicles passing a specific point each day.
   - **Online Resources**: Some traffic count data might be available online through government websites, traffic monitoring services, or transportation research organizations.

### 2. **Calculate Yearly, Monthly, Weekly, and Daily Estimates:**
   - **Daily Traffic**: Use the AADT value. This is usually an average that accounts for seasonal variations.

   - **Weekly Traffic**: Multiply the daily traffic by 7.
   - **Monthly Traffic**: Multiply the daily traffic by the average number of days in a month (~30.42).
   - **Yearly Traffic**: Multiply the daily traffic by 365.

### 3. **Breakdown of Estimates:**

   Suppose the AADT for a specific section of I-95 is 100,000 vehicles per day.

   - **Daily Estimate**: \( 100,000 \) vehicles/day
   - **Weekly Estimate**:
     - 1 week: \( 100,000 \times 7 = 700,000 \) vehicles
     - 2 weeks: \( 100,000 \times 14 = 1,400,000 \) vehicles
     - 3 weeks: \( 100,000 \times 21 = 2,100,000 \) vehicles
   - **Monthly Estimate**:
     - \( 100,000 \times 30.42 \approx 3,042,000 \) vehicles/month
   - **Yearly Estimate**:
     - \( 100,000 \times 365 = 36,500,000 \) vehicles/year

### 4. **Consider Variations:**
   - Traffic can vary significantly depending on the time of year, day of the week, and specific location along I-95. For example, holiday seasons or summer vacations might see higher traffic volumes, while weekdays may have more traffic compared to weekends.
   - Weather, construction, and special events can also affect traffic counts.

### 5. **Additional Tools:**
   - **Traffic Simulation Models**: Some advanced traffic analysis tools and software can simulate traffic flows and provide more detailed estimates if needed.
   - **GIS Mapping**: Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can be used to map and analyze traffic data spatially.
