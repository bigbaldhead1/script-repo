##
##  Purpose: Creates the files needed to start aria2c
##           as a background daemon process. You can then
##           use other programs made to work with an active
##           server that will use it to download your files.
##
##           I use the chrome extension below:
##           https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aria2-explorer/mpkodccbngfoacfalldjimigbofkhgjn
##
##  Action: Start or stop server.
##
##  Required: Set your own variables at the top of the script.
##
##  Examples:
##             - listen_port=23657 (default 6800)
##             - dht_listen_port=44321:44330
##
##  Important info: You can use the below link to get the aria2c manual
##                  https://aria2.github.io/manual/en/html/aria2c.html#options

bt-enable-lpd=false
# If true is given, after hash check using --check-integrity option and file is complete, continue to seed file. If you want to check file and download it only when it is damaged or incomplete, set this option to false. This option has effect only on BitTorrent download. Default: true

bt-metadata-only=false
# If the whole download speed of every torrent is lower than SPEED, aria2 temporarily increases the number of peers to try for more download speed. Configuring this option with your preferred download speed can increase your download speed in some cases. You can append K or M (1K = 1024, 1M = 1024K). Default: 50K

This option has effect only in BitTorrent, Metalink downloads with checksums or HTTP(S)/FTP downloads with --checksum option. If piece hashes are provided, this option can detect damaged portions of a file and re-download them. If a hash of entire file is provided, hash check is only done when file has been already download. This is determined by file length. If hash check fails, file is re-downloaded from scratch. If both piece hashes and a hash of entire file are provided, only piece hashes are used. Default: false

# Download file only when the local file is older than remote file. This function only works with HTTP(S) downloads only. It does not work if file size is specified in Metalink. It also ignores Content-Disposition header. If a control file exists, this option will be ignored. This function uses If-Modified-Since header to get only newer file conditionally. When getting modification time of local file, it uses user supplied file name (see --out option) or file name part in URI if --out is not specified. To overwrite existing file, --allow-overwrite is required. Default: false
conditional-get=false
# Set the connect timeout in seconds to establish connection to HTTP/FTP/proxy server. After the connection is established, this option makes no effect and --timeout option is used instead. Default: 60
connect-timeout=10
# Handle quoted string in Content-Disposition header as UTF-8 instead of ISO-8859-1, for example, the filename parameter, but not the extended version filename. Default: false

disk-cache=64M
# This option changes the way Download Results is formatted. If OPT is default, print GID, status, average download speed and path/URI. If multiple files are involved, path/URI of first requested file is printed and remaining ones are omitted. If OPT is full, print GID, status, average download speed, percentage of progress and path/URI. The percentage of progress and path/URI are printed for each requested file in each row. If OPT is hide, Download Results is hidden. Default: default

enable-peer-exchange=true
# Enable JSON-RPC/XML-RPC server. Default: false
enable-rpc=true
# Specify file allocation method. none doesn't pre-allocate file space. prealloc pre-allocates file space before download begins. This may take some time depending on the size of the file. If you are using newer file systems such as ext4 (with extents support), btrfs, xfs or NTFS(MinGW build only), falloc is your best choice. It allocates large(few GiB) files almost instantly. Don't use falloc with legacy file systems such as ext3 and FAT32 because it takes almost same time as prealloc and it blocks aria2 entirely until allocation finishes. falloc may not be available if your system doesn't have posix_fallocate(3) function. trunc uses ftruncate(2) system call or platform-specific counterpart to truncate a file to a specified length. Possible Values: none, prealloc, trunc, falloc. Default: prealloc
file-allocation=falloc
# If true or mem is specified, when a file whose suffix is .torrent or content type is application/x-bittorrent is downloaded, aria2 parses it as a torrent file and downloads files mentioned in it. If mem is specified, a torrent file is not written to the disk, but is just kept in memory. If false is specified, the .torrent file is downloaded to the disk, but is not parsed as a torrent and its contents are not downloaded. Default: true

force-sequential=false
# Send Accept: deflate, gzip request header and inflate response if remote server responds with Content-Encoding: gzip or Content-Encoding: deflate. Default: false
# Some server responds with Content-Encoding: gzip for files which itself is gzipped file. aria2 inflates them anyway because of the response header.
http-accept-gzip=false
# Send HTTP authorization header only when it is requested by the server. If false is set, then authorization header is always sent to the server. There is an exception: if user name and password are embedded in URI, authorization header is always sent to the server regardless of this option. Default: false
http-auth-challenge=true
# Send Cache-Control: no-cache and Pragma: no-cache header to avoid cached content. If false is given, these headers are not sent and you can add Cache-Control header with a directive you like using --header option. Default: false
http-no-cache=true
# Print sizes and speed in human readable format (e.g., 1.2Ki, 3.4Mi) in the console readout. Default: true
human-readable=true
# Downloads the URIs listed in FILE. You can specify multiple sources for a single entity by putting multiple URIs on a single line separated by the TAB character. Additionally, options can be specified after each URI line. Option lines must start with one or more white space characters (SPACE or TAB) and must only contain one option per line. Input files can use gzip compression. When FILE is specified as -, aria2 will read the input from stdin. See the Input File subsection for details. See also the --deferred-input option.

# When used with --always-resume=false, aria2 downloads file from scratch when aria2 detects N number of URIs that does not support resume. If N is 0, aria2 downloads file from scratch when all given URIs do not support resume. See --always-resume option. Default: 0
max-resume-failure-tries=3
# Set number of tries. 0 means unlimited. See also --retry-wait. Default: 5

no-netrc=true
# Optimizes the number of concurrent downloads according to the bandwidth available. aria2 uses the download speed observed in the previous downloads to adapt the number of downloads launched in parallel according to the rule N = A + B Log10(speed in Mbps). The coefficients A and B can be customized in the option arguments with A and B separated by a colon. The default values (A=5, B=25) lead to using typically 5 parallel downloads on 1Mbps networks and above 50 on 100Mbps networks.

# Specify URI selection algorithm. The possible values are inorder, feedback and adaptive. If inorder is given, URI is tried in the order appeared in the URI list. If feedback is given, aria2 uses download speed observed in the previous downloads and choose fastest server in the URI list. This also effectively skips dead mirrors. The observed download speed is a part of performance profile of servers mentioned in --server-stat-of and --server-stat-if options. If adaptive is given, selects one of the best mirrors for the first and reserved connections. For supplementary ones, it returns mirrors which has not been tested yet, and if each of them has already been tested, returns mirrors which has to be tested again. Otherwise, it doesn't select anymore mirrors. Like feedback, it uses a performance profile of servers. Default:
uri-selector=feedback
# Use HEAD method for the first request to the HTTP server. Default: false
use-head=false
# Set user agent for HTTP(S) downloads. Default: aria2/$VERSION, $VERSION is replaced by package version.
